Write a bio about myself? Hm! Let's start from the beginning.
I was born on a Friday the 13th. And that's okay because I'm not superstitious. Are you? Michael Scott is a little-stitious.

Jokes aside, my name is Bernardo, but most people call me Bibo. I'm from Salvador, the first capital of Brazil. I completed high school in 2006 and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in **Electrical Engineering** from the Federal University of Bahia ([UFBA](https://www.ufba.br)) in 2014. I received my master's degree in the same field from the same university in 2017, and I began my Ph.D. in **Electrical Engineering** in 2019. My research focused on control systems, specifically ensuring their stability over an infinite horizon. This field of research has applications in several areas, including autonomous vehicles, aerospace operations, and renewable energy management, enhancing safety and efficiency. However, I wasn't quite happy, which led to a transition into **Computer Science**.

<blockquote>
"Wait, whaaattt? What about <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong>?"

I dropped out of my Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering in 2020 to pursue a new career in Computer Science. That same year, I started a new undergraduate program, this time in Computer Science, at Salvador University (UNIFACs), while starting a new computer science Ph.D program at UFBA. I brought with me all the electrical engineering foundation, but not much beyond that. For me, it is a new beginning, a new challenge. I'm excited to do what I love and embrace the opportunity to learn new things.

Currently, I'm a Ph.D. candidate, member of the [Ivision Lab](https://ivisionlab.ufba.br), at the UFBA, where I'm working with Deep Learning for automatic report generation on panoramic radiographs. In 2024, I also began a new position at [IFBA](https://portal.ifba.edu.br) as a Computer Science professor, where I am teaching courses in Programming Languages and Installation, Building and Maintenance of Computers.

I also think I'm funny and "I have approximately knowledge of many things".
