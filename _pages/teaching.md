I'm currently teaching at [Institutito Federal da Bahia (IFBA)](https://portal.ifba.edu.br/), where I teach the following courses:
- Installation, Assembly and Maintenance of Hardware I and II;
- Programming Languages

For the Programming Languages course, I am developing a Jupyter Notebook that encompasses all the course content. You can access the notebook [here](https://github.com/bpmsilva/ifbacanas/blob/main/linguagem-de-programacao.ipynb). The notebook is in Portuguese.
