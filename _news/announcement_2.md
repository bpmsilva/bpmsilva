I am delighted to announce that I have started a new position as a Computer Science Professor at the [Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Bahia (IFBA)](www.ifba.edu.br). IFBA is a federal institution that offers professional and technological education in various areas of knowledge, featuring a wide range of curricula across multiple campuses. I am currently assigned to the campus in Valença, a city three hours away from Salvador, the capital of Bahia. Valença is known as a gateway to beaches. Unfortunately, I am not a beach person (yet).
